\usage{
rf.funs(
  ntree = 500,
  varfrac = 0.333,
  replace = TRUE,
  obsfrac = ifelse(replace, 1, 0.632),
  nodesize = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ntree}{Number of trees to grow. Default is 500.}

\item{varfrac}{Determines the number of variables used as candidates at each
split: this is floor(varfrac * p), where p is the total number of
variables. Default is 0.333.}

\item{replace}{Should sampling of observations done with or without
replacement? Default is FALSE.}

\item{obsfrac}{Determines the number of observations used by each tree: this
is floor(obsfrac * n), where n is the number of training observations.
Default is 1 when replace is TRUE, and 0.632 when replace is FALSE.}

\item{nodesize}{Sought size of terminal nodes, in growing each tree. Default
is 5.}
}
\value{
A list with three components: train.fun, predict.fun, active.fun.
  The third function is designed to take the output of train.fun, and
  reports which features are active for the fitted model contained in
  this output.
}
\description{
Construct training and prediction functions for random forests.
}
\details{
This function is based on the packages \code{\link{randomForest}} 
  and \code{\link{plyr}}. If these packages are not installed, then the 
  function will abort.
